  <p>Web architectures are an important asset for various large-scale web applications. Being able to handle huge numbers of users concurrently is essential, thus scalability is one of the most important features of these architectures. Multi-core processors, highly distributed backend architectures and new web technologies force us to reconsider approaches for concurrent programming in order to implement web applications and fulfil scalability demands.</p>
  
  <p>This diploma thesis provides a comprehensive survey on the myriads of different concepts and techniques of concurrency inside web architectures. It incorporates research publications, hands-on reports and also regards popular programming languages, frameworks and databases. We devise an architectural model for scalable web architectures and provide separate concurrency analyses of three main components: web servers, application servers and storage backends. We  examine the relations between concurrency, scalability and distributed systems and dare an outlook on the near future.</p>
